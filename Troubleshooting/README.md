# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide provides troubleshooting steps for common issues that may arise during the debugging and troubleshooting phase of the e-commerce application deployment. Each issue is described along with potential causes and suggested solutions.

## Issue 1: Frontend Accessibility

### Issue Description:
The frontend service is not accessible externally post-deployment.

### Potential Causes:
1. Networking misconfiguration.
2. Ingress configuration issues.

### Troubleshooting Steps:
1. Verify that the frontend service is running and healthy within the cluster.
2. Check the networking configuration to ensure that the frontend service is exposed correctly.
3. Verify the Ingress configuration and ensure that it is properly routing traffic to the frontend service.
4. Check for any firewall rules or network policies that may be blocking external access to the frontend service.
5. Review the Ingress controller logs for any errors or warnings related to the frontend service.

### Solution:
1. Ensure that the frontend service is running and healthy.
2. Verify the networking configuration, including the service and Ingress settings.
3. Double-check the Ingress configuration to ensure proper routing.
4. Check for any firewall rules or network policies that may be blocking external access.
5. Review the Ingress controller logs for any errors or warnings.

## Issue 2: Intermittent Backend-Database Connectivity

### Issue Description:
The backend services occasionally lose connection to the MongoDB cluster, causing request failures.

### Potential Causes:
1. Network connectivity issues between the backend services and the MongoDB cluster.
2. Service discovery issues causing incorrect MongoDB connection details.
3. MongoDB configuration issues.

### Troubleshooting Steps:
1. Check the network connectivity between the backend services and the MongoDB cluster.
2. Verify that the backend services are using the correct MongoDB connection details.
3. Review the MongoDB configuration for any potential issues.
4. Monitor the backend service logs for any connection errors or timeouts.
5. Check for any network policies or firewall rules that may be blocking the backend services' access to the MongoDB cluster.

### Solution:
1. Ensure that there is a stable network connection between the backend services and the MongoDB cluster.
2. Verify that the backend services are using the correct MongoDB connection details.
3. Review and adjust the MongoDB configuration if necessary.
4. Monitor the backend service logs for any connection errors or timeouts.
5. Check for any network policies or firewall rules that may be blocking the backend services' access to the MongoDB cluster.

## Issue 3: Order Processing Delays

### Issue Description:
Users report delays in order processing, suspecting issues with the RabbitMQ message queue.

### Potential Causes:
1. Message queue configuration issues.
2. High message queue load or congestion.
3. Suboptimal message processing setup.

### Troubleshooting Steps:
1. Review the RabbitMQ configuration for any potential issues.
2. Monitor the message queue load and check for any congestion.
3. Analyze the message processing setup and identify any bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
4. Check for any errors or warnings in the message queue logs.
5. Monitor the backend service logs for any delays or errors related to message processing.

### Solution:
1. Review and adjust the RabbitMQ configuration if necessary.
2. Monitor the message queue load and optimize the setup to handle the expected load.
3. Analyze the message processing setup and optimize it for efficiency.
4. Check the message queue logs for any errors or warnings.
5. Monitor the backend service logs for any delays or errors related to message processing.
