# E-commerce Application Deployment

This repository contains the Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) for deploying the e-commerce application. The application consists of a frontend, backend API, MongoDB database, and RabbitMQ message queue.

## System Context

The e-commerce application is composed of the following components:

1. **Frontend**: A React-based web application served by an Nginx server.
2. **Backend API**: A set of Node.js microservices handling various business operations.
3. **Database**: A MongoDB cluster for data persistence.
4. **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ for handling order processing asynchronously.

## Assumptions

The following assumptions were made during the deployment:

1. Kubernetes cluster is already set up and running.
2. The metrics server is installed and running in the cluster for Horizontal Pod Autoscaling.
3. Infrastructure supports Cluster Autoscaling if implemented.
4. Grafana and ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) are already installed and configured.

## Deployment

The deployment phase consists of the following steps:

1. **Configuration and Deployment**: Create Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) for each component, ensuring proper configuration, interconnection, and deployment strategies (e.g., RollingUpdate). The YAML files are provided in this repository.
2. **Networking**: Configure the Ingress controller to expose the frontend service with proper URL routing. Set up internal networking with appropriate service discovery mechanisms for inter-service communication.
3. **Persistence**: Implement Persistent Volumes and Claims for MongoDB and RabbitMQ to ensure data persistence and resilience.
4. **Security and Compliance**: Define and enforce security policies using Pod Security Policies or OPA/Gatekeeper to ensure least privilege access and other security best practices.

## YAML Files

The following YAML files are provided in this repository:

1. `frontend-deployment.yaml`: Deployment YAML for the frontend service.
2. `backend-deployment.yaml`: Deployment YAML for the backend API.
3. `mongodb-deployment.yaml`: Deployment YAML for the MongoDB database.
4. `rabbitmq-deployment.yaml`: Deployment YAML for the RabbitMQ message queue.
5. `frontend-configmap.yaml`: ConfigMap YAML for managing frontend application configuration.
6. `backend-secret.yaml`: Secret YAML for managing sensitive data for the backend API.
7. `mongodb-pvc.yaml`: PersistentVolumeClaim YAML for MongoDB data persistence.
8. `rabbitmq-pvc.yaml`: PersistentVolumeClaim YAML for RabbitMQ data persistence.
9. `frontend-ingress.yaml`: Ingress YAML for exposing the frontend service with proper URL routing.
10. `prometheus-deployment.yaml`: Deployment YAML for Prometheus

## Monitoring and Logging

To monitor the performance and resource usage of all components, Prometheus and Grafana are integrated. The Prometheus deployment and service YAML files are provided in this repository. Configure Grafana to connect to Prometheus as a data source and create dashboards to visualize the collected metrics.

For centralized logging, the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) is set up. The Logstash deployment and service YAML files are not provided in this repository. Configure Logstash to collect logs from all components and configure Kibana to analyze and visualize the logs.

## Conclusion

This README provides an overview of the e-commerce application deployment and the associated YAML files. Follow the deployment steps and customize the YAML files based on your specific requirements and infrastructure setup.

Please note that this README assumes certain infrastructure and platform configurations. Adjust the instructions and configurations according to your system context and requirements.
